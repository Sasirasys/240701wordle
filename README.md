# Wordle Game
- This project is built following the tutorial from "Build Wordle in 20min with React.js!"(https://youtu.be/oTVFno-IZVc?si=3JXNx3llBVnjWgUb)
- new things learned: observer, useLocalObservable from 'mobx-react-lite'
- The observer converts a component into a reactive component, which tracks which observables are used automatically and re-renders the component when one of these values changes.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

install library

```bash
npm install mobx-react-lite
```

run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
